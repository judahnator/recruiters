Recruiters / Whoever
====================

I have moved away from GitHub, but never fear! All of my work is still open source and available to all!

Where can you find me?
----------------------

* You can find my published work on [packagist](https://packagist.org/users/judahnator/)
* Misc open source stuff I am working on can be found at my [gitlab profile](https://gitlab.com/judahnator)
* My blog is [this way](https://judahwright.me)
* Consulting work can be found [over here](http://judahwrightconsultingllc.com/)

What is left here?
------------------

Although I do not use GitHub for personal projects, many of the projects I contribute to are still here. You can find some forks of projects I contribute to on my profile, and maybe a few other projects that will be difficult to move.
